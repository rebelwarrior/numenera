{:.subtitle.is-4.mt-4} 

The Strange is actually cooler than Numeneara because it meshes so many genres it can be used to have many different kinds of games in one campaign. In the Strange there are portals to different worlds; worlds that seem to be born from the tales and imagination of people on earth but are real... and someone has to stop these worlds from spilling into ours...
