# Character Creation 
{:.title.is-1} 

### Steps:
{:.subtitle.is-3} 

Grab the [Character Sheet]({{ site.url}}/assets/pdfs/CharacterSheet.pdf)

#### 1. Choose Type (1/6)
{:.subtitle.is-4.mt-4} 

1. Glaive ("_Sword_" in French, btw)
2. Nano   (_Wizards_)
3. Jack   (_Generalists_)
4. Arkus  (_Speakers_)
5. Wright (_Crafters_)
6. Delve  (_Explorers_)
{:.ml-6}

In the original Numenera only three types were available (Glaive, Nano and Jack) and I suggest you stick to those when starting out. Unlike other systems, in Numeneara it is the combination of your type, descriptor and focus that really define your character, so your type is only about one third of your character.

Characters can be devided into multiple archetypes: Your best game divides them into 8 archetypes and The Monsters really know what they're doing into 4 battle archetypes. But the way Numenera deals with the descriptor type and focus allows you to mix and match more easily. So don't worry too much about that. 

Go to the [Starting Values Table]({{ site.url}}/tables/starting_values) and put them on your character sheet. 


#### 2. Chose Descriptor (1/47)
{:.subtitle.is-4.mt-4} 

Don't read the descriptors, first find an adjective or two that describes your character. Then read the list and see what applies and pick two or three. Read the description for those.

<br>
For example: your character is kind.  
Looking at the list you can pick _beneficent_, maybe _civic_, and _nurturing_.  
Read those and choose one.   


#### 3. Choose Focus (1/39)
{:.subtitle.is-4.mt-4} 

Foci are like super-powers or feats of ability your character can do. They can be used to enhance to your tier abilities, like a jack that works the back alleys is a thief, but they don't always have to. 

Look at teh [Foci Table]({{ site.url}}/tables/foci) which has comic book and movie references and fantasy class hints to help you choose.

For example: Do you want to play a character like Super Mario? 
Check out "Breaks down walls"

#### 4. Choose Two Type Abilities (2/5 - 2/9)
{:.subtitle.is-4.mt-4} 

Your Type has at least a five options for you to __choose 2 tier abilities__ corresponding to your type at tier one. Pick these after your focus since you'll want them to compliment each other. See the [Tier Abilities Table]({{ site.url}}/tables/tier_abilities.md)


#### 5. Resolve Skills Choices (from Type or Focus).
{:.subtitle.is-4.mt-4} 

There is no set skill list. Skills are one of only three things that can lower the dificulty of a task.
Your Type and/or your Focus may give you skills from a list to choose from too, pick those.  


#### 6. Starting Equipment  
{:.subtitle.is-4.mt-4} 

Now you and your Game Master (GM) will select what starting equipment you have. Remember that descriptors and foci can give extra equipment. Pay special attention to the cyphers. 

Armor reduces the damage you recieve.  
Wearing Armor has penalties, however. Armor works like a reverse Edge for Speed Rolls, it increases the cost of Effort (per level) applied to Speed rolls. Many types have abilities that reduce the cost of wearing armor. 

A Shield gives an asset (equivalent to a +3 advantage) to Speed Defense rolls. That is the roll to avoid getting hit. 

Light weapons deal only 2 points of damage but also eases the attack roll by one step (equivalent to a +3 to hit advantage).

#### 7. The Rest
{:.subtitle.is-4.mt-4} 


##### Name & Look
{:.subtitle.is-5.mt-4} 

Now pick a name for your character and sketch a rough look (with words or pictures). 

##### Introduce yourself to the party & resolve Connections (from Focus)
{:.subtitle.is-5.mt-4} 
Connections create ties between the players. Connections are listed in your Focus. 

##### Fleshout your Background
{:.subtitle.is-5.mt-4} 

Pick your Background and the answer to the question:  `Why does your character adventure?` Refer to those section of your tier, focus and description choices. Your descriptor has suggestions for the _Initial Link to the Starting Adventure_.
