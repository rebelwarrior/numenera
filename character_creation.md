1. Glaive ("sword" in French, btw)

5. Wright (Crafters)
6. Delve (Explorers)

#### Chose Descriptor (1/47)
{:.subtitle.is-4} 

Don't read the descriptors, first find an adjective or two that describes your character. Then read the list and see what applies and two or three. Read the description for those.

For example: your character is kind.
Looking at the list you can pick beneficent, maybe civic, and nurturing.
Read those and pick one.  

#### Choose Focus (1/39)
{:.subtitle.is-4} 

Foci are like super-powers or feats of ability your character can do. They can be tied to your tier like a jack that works the back alleys is a thief, but they don't always have to. 

#### Choose Two Type Abilities (1/5 - 1/9)
{:.subtitle.is-4} 

Your Type has at least a 5 options for you to choose 2 abilities corresponding to your type at tier one. Pick these after your focus since you'll want them to compliment each other. 

#### Resolve Skills Choices (from Type or Focus).
{:.subtitle.is-4} 

Your Type or your Focus may give you skills from a list to choose from, pick those.  

#### Starting Equipment

Now you and your Dungeon Master (DM) will select what starting equipment you have. Remember that descriptors and foci can give extra equipment. 


#### Name & Look

Now pick a name for your character and sketch a rough look. 


#### Background
{:.subtitle.is-4}
