# Character Archetypes
{:.title.is-1} 

## Your Best Game Ever By Monte Cook
{:.subtitle.is-3} 

Your Best Game Ever talks about a generalist archetype or a focused character and presents 8 archetypes for the focused character:

1. Warrior : deals damage
2. Tank : can take a lot of damage
3. Sneak : sneaky
4. Face : good at talking
5. Specialist : one area of knowledge
6. Shaper : moves around the battle field
7. Nullifier : nullifies opponents 
8. Supporter : aids usually by healing

These are far too many in my opinion. 

## Live to Tell the Tale by Keith Ammann
{:.subtitle.is-3.mt-3} 

Live to Tell the Tale presents 6 ability contours for a D&D-type game based on their abilities:

1. Front Line : Tank/Melee 
2. Shock Attacker :  Sneak Attacker (Assasin)
3. Skirmisher : Ranged or Finesse-weapon attacker
4. Marksman : Range only attacker (Sniper)
5. Supporter : Aids usually by healing
6. Slinger/Glass Cannon : Deal lots of damage but can't take any.

## My Take on Archetypes 
{:.subtitle.is-3} 

Based rather heavily on Keith Ammann work, I like to sum this up into 4 battle archetypes:

1. Front-line : Tank, Warrior
2. Second-line : Armored Supporter, Skirmisher
3. Third-line : Marksman, Shock Attacker(Sneak Attacker)
4. Protected/Strategist : Glass Cannon 
{:.ml-6}

1. Front-line => Melee Fighter, goes toe-to-toe with the enemies
2. Second-line => Armored Aid, can take a hit but supports or can attack from the second row, either ranged or with a pole-arm. 
3. Third-line => Not very armored, can attack from afar or needs to move in and out of the front row like a sneak attacker.
4. Protected/Strategist => Unable to fight melee effectively, either aids from afar or attacks from afar.

These make more sense but none quite map to Numenera because:

1. __Any character can wear armor.__ The penalty for wearing armor is not being able to avoid getting hit as easily. So if you're good at avoiding getting hit like a Striker, you may not even need armor or a Tank character. You can also quickly get armor or loose it as the group make-up changes. There is flexibility in armor. 
2. Damage can be on any one of the pools exclusively. This prevents the whole hit-points being one single pool. 
3. __No single character-type has a monopoly__ on massive damage capabilities like a Wizard in D&D does. 
4. Only three ability scores as opposed to six in other RPGs. 
5. The __importance of non-combat roles__ in Numenera is larger than in other RPGs.

## Conclusion
{:.subtitle.is-3} 

The value of looking at the archetype in Numenera lies in __giving a group variety__, preventing characters from filling the same role in the group and clashing. By looking at archetypes you can find or carve __a niche for your character__ from the get go.
