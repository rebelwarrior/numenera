# Character Archetypes

## Your Best Game Ever

Talks about a generalist archetype or a focused character and presents 8 archetypes for the focused character:

1. Warrior : deals damage
2. Tank : can take a lot of damage
3. Sneak : sneaky
4. Face : good at talking
5. Specialist : one area of knowledge
6. Shaper : moves around the battle field
7. Nullifier : nullifies opponents 
8. Supporter : aids usually by healing

These are far to many in my opinion. 

## The Monsters Know What they're Doing

Presents 4 archetypes for a D&D-type game:

1. Striker : Deals damage but can't take too many blows so moves around or attacks ranged.
2. Tank/Melee : Can take damage like a tank.
3. Support : Aids other players usually by healing
3. Strategist : A glass cannon. Can inflict massive damage but can't take any.

These make more sense but none quite map to Numenera because:

1. Any character can wear armor. The penalty for wearing armor is not being able to avoid getting hit as easily. So if you're good at avoiding getting hit like a Striker, you may not even need armor or a Tank character. 
2. Damage can be on any one of the pools exclusively. This prevents the whole hit-points being one single pool. 
3. No character single type has a monopoly on massive damage capabilities like a Wizard in D&D does.

So we're back to looking at the 8 archetypes. It makes sense for a group to avoid getting more than one of each. And that can be helpful in creating a character.
