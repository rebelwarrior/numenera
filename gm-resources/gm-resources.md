### Keys
{:.title.is-4}

In Numenera's __Instant Adventures__ two neat concepts are introduced. (books: Weird Discoveries and Strange Revelations and Explorer's Keys) Instant adventures rely on these to drive the quick mostly improvised adventures, and they can be useful in your own adventures. Rather than a set path these adventures rely on _keys_ or story points that drive the story forward. There are two kinds of keys.  
<br>
1. Keys that are Probably Necessary.
These are story points that are necessary for the progress in the adventure.
2. Keys that Make things Interesting.
Their main purpose is to "inject drama into the meta-game."
{:.ml-6}
By using this keys the PCs don't know if it is a necessary key or one meant to make things interesting. They have to figure it out.

## Other Cypher Systems
{:.title.is-3.mt-2}
There are other RPGs that use the Cypher System, like _The Strange_ and _Predation_ and the Generic _Cypher System_.

### The Strange
{:.subtitle.is-5.mt-4}

In _The Strange_ there are portals to different worlds; worlds that seem to be born from the tales and imagination of people on earth but are real... and someone has to stop these worlds from spilling into ours...

> The Strange meshes so many genres it can be used to have many different kinds of games in one campaign.

### Cypher System
{:.subtitle.is-5.mt-4}

These are the general rules that allow you to play in many genres like Fantasy, Modern Urban, Sci-fi, Superhero, etc.
