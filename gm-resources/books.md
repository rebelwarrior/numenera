# Numenera Books
{:.title.is-4.mt-2}

Numenera is a subset of Cypher System books. The Numenera setting is fantastic and very well developed but because it has a lot of materials it can be hard to navigate. 

## What do you need to play? 
{:.title.is-4.mt-2}

You just need the core books to play: [Discovery][] and [Destiny][]. Almost all the core rules are in Discovery so you can just start with that one. 

If you're just checking Numenera out take a look at the *free resources*. There is enough there to get started, particularly the **[Cypher Rules Primer][]**.

## What do you need to GM? 
{:.title.is-4.mt-2}

To run Numenera (GM) I'd recommend the [Explorer's Keys][]. You don't need a Bestiary but it could be useful. Additionally Monte Cook produces a whole bunch of supplements that could be useful as well like cards with cyphers [Cypher Cards][]. 

For longer campaign-style adventures the [The Devil's Spine][] is an impressive adventure.

### Quick Adventures
{:.title.is-4.mt-2}
1. [Explorer's Keys][] (excellent)
2. [Weird Discoveries][] (very good)

These [books of short adventures][] are fantastic. These adventures are meant for one session and to be mostly improvised.

### Free Content:
{:.title.is-4.mt-2}

There is also a ton of free content I recommend getting:
1. [Cypher Rules Primer][]
2. [Numenera Free Legacy Content][] (contains adventure _Beal of Boregal_) also at [drive thru](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/253970/Original-Numenera-Corebook-Legacy-Content)
3. [Ashes of the Sea][] free adventure with quick start rules.

### Bestiaries and Compendiums
{:.title.is-4.mt-2}

[Technology Compendium][] (Cyphers)  
<br>
[Ninth World Bestiary][]  
[Ninth World Bestiary 2][]  
[Ninth World Bestiary 3][]  
<br>

### Source books
{:.title.is-4.mt-3}

[Building Tomorrow][] (Communities)  
[Numenera Character Options 2][] (More options for Character Types, Foci and Descriptors)
<br>
[Ninth World Guidebook][] (Expands Core book and the lands of the Gaians, and others around Steadfast)  
[Torment: Tides of Numenera – The Explorer's Guide][] (Garravia, the land of Torment)    
<br>
[Priests of the Aeons][]  
<br>
[Into the Outside][] (Extra Dimensions)  
[Into the Deep][] (The Deep Ocean)  
[Into the Night][] (Outer Space)  
[Voices of the Datasphere][] (CyberSpace)  
[Edge of the Sun][]
[Liminal Shore][] (Biological World)  
[Break the Horizon][]
[Building Tomorrow][]
[The Glimmering Valley][]
<br>

These guidebooks expand the world but in general aren’t very useful for play. I liked [Ninth World Guidebook][] as it’s a sort of Gazetteer of other areas to explore.
