To play Numenera you only really need **the core book [Discovery][]**. However, many of the character options are in **[Destiny][]**. If you're just checking Numenera out take a look at the *free resources*. There is enough there to get started, particularly the **[Cypher Rules Primer][]**.

To run Numenera (GM) I'd recommend the [Explorer's Keys][]. You don't need a Bestiary but it could be useful.

For longer campaign-style adventures, there are three available that I have:
1. [The Devil's Spine][]
2. [Jade Colossus][] (have not read)
3. [Slaves of the Machine God][]

I highly recommend the Devil's Spine.

# Books To Get
{:.title.is-3.mt-2}

## Core Books:
{:.title.is-4.mt-2}

1. [Discovery][]  
2. [Destiny][]

After that my recommendation is to get:

### Adventures & Extras:
{:.title.is-4.mt-2}

[Explorer's Keys][]
{:.title.is-5.mt-2}

This [book of short adventures][] is fantastic. These adventures are meant for one session and to be mostly improvised. They're written in a short format, like its predecessor [Weird Discoveries][], but unlike that book, this one has maps only on one page instead of split between two (making it way easier to deal with on PDF format) and the adventures are tighter in my opinion.

### Free Content:
{:.title.is-4.mt-2}
