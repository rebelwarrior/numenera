To play Numenera you only really need **the core book Discovery**. However, many of the character options are in Destiny. If you're just checking Numenera out take a look at the free resources. There is enough there to get started, particularly **the Cypher Rules Primer**. 

# Books To Get
{:.title.is-3.mt-2} 

To play Numenera you need at least the [Discovery][] core book. Though I would recommend pairing that with [Destiny][] (or [Player's Guide][]) to get a larger group of descriptors and foci. 

<br>

After that my recommendation is to get:

## [Explorer's Keys][]
{:.title.is-3.mt-2}

This [book of short adventures][] is fantastic. These adventures are meant for one session and to be mostly improvised. They're written in a short format, like it's predecessor [Weird Discoveries][] but unlike that book this one has maps only on one page instead of split between two making it way easier to deal with on PDF format and the adventures are more tight in my opinion.  

## Free Content
{:.title.is-3.mt-2}

3. [Ashes of the Sea](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/247640/Ashes-of-the-Sea-FREE-Numenera-Quickstart-Rules-and-Adventure) free adventure with quick start rules.
