To play Numenera you need at least the [Discovery][] core book. Though I would recommend pairing that with [Destiny][] or [Player's Guide][] to get a larger group of descriptors and foci. 

<br>

After that my recommendation is to get:

## [Explorer's Keys][]
{:.title.is-3.mt-2} 

![]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/thumbs/explorers-keys-thumb.jpg)

This [book of short adventures][] is fantastic. These adventures are meant for one session and to be mostly improvised. They're written in a short format, like it's predecessor [Weird Discoveries][] but unlike that book this one has maps only on one page instead of split between two making it way easier to deal with on PDF format and the adventures are more tight in my opinion.  

## Free Content

There is also a ton of free content I recommend getting:
1. [RPG Consent in Gaming Form](https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/consent-in-gaming/)
2. [Cypher Rules Primer](https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/cypher-system-rules-primer/) 
3. [Numenera Free Legacy Content](https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/numenera-discovery-and-destiny/) (contains adventure Beal of Boregal) also at [drive thru](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/253970/Original-Numenera-Corebook-Legacy-Content)
4. [Ashes of the Sea free adventure with quick start rules.](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/247640/Ashes-of-the-Sea-FREE-Numenera-Quickstart-Rules-and-Adventure)

## More Adventures:
{:.title.is-3.mt-2} 

### [Into the Violet Vale][]
{:.title.is-4.mt-2}

Short adventure also suited for improvised play.

### [The Devil's Spine][]
{:.title.is-4.mt-2} 

![]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/thumbs/devils-spine-thumb.jpg)

Long involved adventure more like a campaign.
