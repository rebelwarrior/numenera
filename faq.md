# Big Differences with D&D
{:.title.is-1} 

1. Initiative is rolled only once, on the first round and then followed from then on. 
2. The players roll all the dice. (Mostly.)
3. Armor is easier to wear than on D&D. 
4. Player's tier (level) is not as important as on D&D. 
5. You can only do _one_ action per round; movement is an action (unless it's an immediate distance).
6. Melee attacks can be Might or Speed rolls, player's choice. Range attacks are usually Speed rolls.
7. Characters heal by resting.
