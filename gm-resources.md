### Keys 
{:.title.is-4} 

In Numenera Instant Adventures two concepts are introduced. (Weird Discoveries and Strange Revelations)

1. Keys that are Probably Necessary
These are necessary for the progress in the adventure.

2. Keys that Make things Interesting
Their main purpose is to "inject drama into the meta-game." By using this keys the PCs don't know if it is a necessary key or one meant to make things interesting. They have to figure it out.
