{:.title.is-2.mt-2}

Add danger sense to Lives In the Wilderness focus on Tier 1.

## Pack 12 Item slot

You have 12 item slots within reach; roll a d12 (optional) for the target slot or over to get it or you have to spend a turn getting it.

Anything beyond those 12 requires a least a turn to dig out of your back pack.

House Rule: Only 12 items slots are within reach. You must search for the rest.

## Initiative Ã  la Dungeon World
Who speaks first goes first. 

## Edge and applying Effort
Rather than the 3 then 2 to apply effort: Everyone starts with a -1 on Edge. Same effect, easier math. Now always 2 to apply effort.

__Danger Sense:__ After living in a particular wilderness for more than a few days, you can sense if you're in danger from one of the natural predators in that wilderness. You can't be surprised by natural predators in the wilderness you live in.
