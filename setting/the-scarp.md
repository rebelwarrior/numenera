# The Scarp
{:.title.is-1.mt-2}
Possible Starting Location

## The Shepherds of the Scarp 

## The Abandoned Monastery of the Scarp

## The Myst Sea

## The Underground Bunker 

Below the grasses is a network of tunnels where the shepherds make their houses. These were clearly part of some sort of living quarters from a previous age. The cubbies that are used as beds are small, like for children and the present occupants build extensions with wood and dirt, yet beyond that, no markers of signs of any kind point to what the previous habitants of the bunker may have been. 

The bunker is the main reason living in the Scarp is possible as when the Iron Wind runs over the grasslands the inhabitants and thier sheep is possible can seek refuge below ground in air-tight seals of the bunker. Not all the bunker has been explored and not all of it is air-tight so only a few areas are deemed safe for habitation. Nobody has returned from exploring the flooded lower leves of the bunker so those areas are sealed off or blocked.
