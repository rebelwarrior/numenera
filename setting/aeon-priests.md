# Aeon Priests 

Aeon Priests are fairly undefined in the setting allowing for great interpretation and flexibility for the GM. Here are my take on them. 

Function:
The Aeon Priests are both a monastic order and a quasi-religious organization. The organization side is much like the Church in medieval Europe and provides cohesion to all of Steadfast. In many ways, Steadfast doesn't fall apart because of the Aeon Priests. To this function the Aeon Priests have a near monopoly on scribes, and this allows them to arbiter contracts, treaties and any government document. In this function Aeon Priests directly report to the Amber Pope through its Archbishops, who sometimes encourage, manipulate or outright get involved in the political waters of Steadfast with the goal of preventing outright war and fomenting cohesion. 

The monastic order side is somewhat independent and follows guiding principles in its operation but it only inderectly reports to the Amber Pope with each Abbot running their faction more or less independently. The monastic side is more concerned with investigation, learning and knowledge. Semblage and Clave
